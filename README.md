Audio-Driven TurtleBot3 
Objective
 • Develop a TurtleBot3 system that navigates based on audio cues. The project begins with audio pattern classification to control movements in gazebo environment.
 Novelty
 • Using audio signals as direct inputs for navigating a robot. This involves interpreting audio cues to generate directional commands, which is a creative intersection of audio processing and robotics
